# CineGPT: A Movie Recommendation Web Application

## About the Project

This project is a React-based web application inspired by Netflix, featuring a user authentication system, movie browsing capabilities, and a unique GPT-powered search functionality for movie recommendations. It's built with modern web technologies, including React, Redux Toolkit for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The application integrates with both the TMDB (The Movie Database) API for movie data and the OpenAI API for its AI search feature.

## Features

  - **User Authentication:**

      - Secure sign-in and sign-up forms with form validation.
      - Redirects users to the appropriate page (`/browse` for logged-in users, `/` for logged-out).
      - Implements user sign-out functionality.

  - **Movie Browsing:**

      - Displays a main movie container with a background trailer and movie title/description.
      - Shows categorized movie lists (Now Playing, Popular, and Trending).
      - Each movie list contains clickable movie cards.

  - **GPT Search:**

      - A dedicated search page with an input bar.
      - Uses the OpenAI API to generate movie suggestions based on user queries.
      - Integrates TMDB to fetch movie posters for the suggested titles.

  - **Additional Features:**

      - Multi-language support.
      - Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
      - State management with Redux Toolkit.

## Technologies Used

The project is built using a combination of libraries and frameworks to ensure a robust and scalable application.
